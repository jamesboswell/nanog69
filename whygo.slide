Thank you!

* what this is not....
Not here to bash Python   .... I ‚ù§Ô∏è Python
Not a tutorial
Not a comprehensive review, just my experiences
Not a plug for Google .... (psst...Google ping me ;-)

* So why did I start in Go?


Problems with Python

I wanted to write Python 3, but....

- Community is split Python 2 vs Python 3
- 2.7 still supported for 3 more years (officially*) and then ???
- many modules not ported from 2 to 3
- module compatiblity....ok so virtual env everything

Also challenges with scaling code concurrently

_"Hard"_ to do things concurrently
Multiprocessing package works... until it doesn't

A former colleague told me to learn Go...we need Go people here...

*CHALLEGE* *ACCEPTED*


* Hello world in Go

#.code x.go /^func main/,/^}/ HLfmt
.play x.go

* Why Go?

* Unicode support with no fuss
.play for.go
Go is fully UTF-8 compliant!

    Hello, world!
    ‡∏™‡∏ß‡∏±‡∏™‡∏î‡∏µ ‡∏Ñ‡∏£‡∏±‡∏ö, world!
    ‰Ω†Â•Ω, world!
    üòÄ, world!

* Type Safety
Sample Python code
.play badinteger.py

  $ python2 badinteger.py                                                                                                                                                                            130 ‚Üµ

Can you avoid this in Python?  Yes you can but you MUST declare your types

An integer is always an integer
.play integer.go /^func main/,/^}/

* Dynamic Typing

_Dynamic_ compilation can result in errors that exist in code, but are not detected
.code junk.py
You will not catch this until *junk()* is called

  Traceback (most recent call last):
    File "junk.py", line 7, in <module>
      junk()
  junk()
  NameError: global name 'afdfaf' is not defined

* Concurrency

* A non concurrent example
  var langs = []Lang{
  	Lang{name: "Go", url: "http://golang.org"},
  	Lang{name: "Python", url: "http://python.org"},
  	Lang{name: "Perl", url: "https://www.perl.org/"}}

.play geturl.go /^func count/,/^}/
(Everything here is standard lib! [batteries included*])

* What can you do with Go?

* Examples

This presentation is done with Go [present]
- present
- reads plain text .slide format

Docker
InfluxDB
Kubernetes
Etcd

* SNMP/HTTP examples
[wip]

* What can you do?
GoBGP

- integrate a BGP daemon with another application

Custom packet analyzer (gopacket)

- capture packets, and do _something_ with them
SNMP

- gnsnmp
NETCONF

- go-netconf, go-junos

gRPC

- *streaming* *telemetry!!*


* Who uses Go?

Docker.io
Uber
Cloudflare

Soundcloud

Prometheus

Google (of course)
